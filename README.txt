This is simple app to understand and create ASP.NET MVC website on MAC without the help of
Visual Studio template from scratch.

This sample assumes that the reader have the knowledge of how ASP.NET MVC app works in 
Visual Studio and reader is familiar with ASP.NET MVC basic concepts.

This app only contains very nominal things to understand what is needed to create the simple
ASP.NET MVC app.

I have tried to comment all the section to make it clear why they are used. Where ever the comment 
was not possible in file itself, I have created a separate [filename].comment.[ext] file with 
where [filename] and [ext] are same as original filename to put the comment alongwith the text.
